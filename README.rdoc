== Friendship-Book

This app is a toying app to learn how to create mutual friendships.

* A user (e.g. Paul) is able to request a friendship with another user (potential friend Peter)
* Paul has a pending friendship, Peter has a requested friendship
* When Peter accepts friendship request, the status changes to "accepted", if he declines, the pending/requested friendship is deleted.

Based on Railsspace book: I am trying to have two "friendships" per request (one pending and one requested)
